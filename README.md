# Backend For Pipelines

- generate code for ML tasks using templates
  - tasks✔️
  - data processing✔️
  - model definition✔️
  - training configuration✔️
- communicate with UI using FastAPI
  - receive config✔️
  - send back generated code✔️
  - send training command, inference results
- run training or inference scripts and return result to UI

## Running the server

- install uv with `brew install uv` or `python -m pip install uv`
- sync dependencies `uv sync` from root folder of repo
- activate venv `source .venv/bin/activate` (/activate.<shell_ext> if present in .venv/bin)
- run server `python modules/main.py`
- check api at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

- or
- run the release `./main`

## TODO: Build into a cross platform binary

- build one using pyinstaller, need to build on other OS ✔️
- Need to bundle witht The UI using tauri  side-car ✔️* (needs system libs/venv for running)

## TODO: Pending functionalities

1. run the generated code using the UI instead of needing to manually save the file and run
2. Test the server, currently the App only builds something that is basically a boilerplate builder,

- - need to test with different configs, datasets, and actually building the dataloaders.

3. convert the fastAPI app into rust based. there isnt much benefit of using python here.
4.
